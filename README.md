An Online Banking Website
So the name of it is bondex online banking. From the home page, you see the sign in button, which takes you to a login page. in the login page, you also see a link to create account for new users. After Login, you get to the dashboard. In the dashboard, you see the transfer menu along side others line airtime, data, etc. In the side bar, you see edit account. This allows you to either update account or delete account, and finally, you also see transactions which shows you all transactions.
