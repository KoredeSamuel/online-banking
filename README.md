Good evening. So the name i gave ut is Bondek Online Banking. From the files i uploaded, click on the index.html. this is the landing page of the website. On this landing page, there's a short Introduction. On the navigation bar, you will see the sign in botton. When you click on it, you are taken to a login page where you login using your username and password. In the login form, you will see a link to create account which is for new users. When you click this link, you are taken tk a create account form. The form is divided into stages, which are personal information, Additional Information, Contact Information, Account Information and login information. Going back to the login page, after you login, you will be taken to a dashboard page. This contains a side bar and some content. In the content, you see a card, which contains some information such as card balance, expiry date, etc. you also see services which include transfer, airtime, etc. Only the transfer is functional. Lastly, on this main content, you see latest transactions. When yiu click the transfer, you will be taken to a transfer page, which contains a form to inout beneficiary details and all. Back to the dashboard, at the side bar, you see edit account menu, transactions and othere. Only the dashboard, edit account, transactions and log out is functional. Clicking on the edit account, you will be taken to a page which contains two buttons for updating and deleting account. When you click on the transactions in the side bar, you see all transactions made. and finally, clicking log out redirects you to the login page.
